# Launching the Project in a DevContainer

This project uses DevContainers to provide a consistent development environment. We have two separate DevContainer configurations:

1. **MySQL Source Container**: This container is used for database development and is configured in `.devcontainer/mysql-src/devcontainer.json`.
2. **Web Container**: This container is used for web development and is configured in `.devcontainer/web-container/devcontainer.json`.

To launch the project in a DevContainer, click on the buttons below:

<a href="vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInContainer?folderUri=file%3A%2F%2F%2F.%2Fdevcontainer%2Fmysql-src&containerName=mysql-src"><button>Launch MySQL Source Container</button></a>
